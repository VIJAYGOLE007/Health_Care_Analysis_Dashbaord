# Health_Care_Analysis_Dashbaord
Based on the health care analysis dashboard provided, here are three insights:

Cardiovascular Health:
The dashboard shows that 3% of patients have experienced a heart attack, while 1.73% have had a stroke. Although these percentages seem low, they represent significant health concerns. Given that cardiovascular diseases are often preventable, there may be an opportunity to implement targeted prevention strategies and early intervention programs to further reduce these rates.

Health Risk Distribution:
The count of health risk categories indicates that a large portion of patients fall into the "normal" (3.1K) and "moderate high" (1.6K) risk categories. However, there are still 0.4K patients in the "high" risk category and 0.1K in the "critical" risk category. This distribution suggests a need for focused interventions and management strategies for those in the higher risk groups, while also maintaining preventive measures for those in lower risk categories.

Lifestyle and Demographic Factors: Several lifestyle and demographic factors appear to influence health outcomes:
Smoking: 384 patients who smoke are classified as having a high health risk, indicating a clear correlation between smoking and increased health risks.

Exercise: 859 patients exercise for less than 30 minutes, which may contribute to health risks. Promoting increased physical activity could be beneficial.

Age: The health risk count is highest in the 40-49 and 50-59 age groups, suggesting that middle-aged individuals may benefit most from targeted health interventions.

Occupation: There are variations in average weight across different occupation types, with "Others" and "White-collar Job" categories showing higher average weights. This could inform occupation-specific health promotion strategies.
